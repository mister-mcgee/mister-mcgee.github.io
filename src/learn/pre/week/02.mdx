## Constructing the EV3 Driving Base
<Swbat>Follow directions to construct the EV3 driving base.</Swbat>

In your assigned groups use the following instructions to construct the EV3 driving base. Do your best to distribute work fairly by taking turns when fetching parts and completing each step.

## Managing a Project

### Creating a New Project
<Swbat>Understand how to create a new EV3 project using VSCode.</Swbat>

The *LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Micropython* plugin for VSCode provides a simple interface for creating a new project. Select the *LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Micropython* plugin from the left sidebar and then select *Create a new project* from the menu. Give your project a name, select where you would like to save your project and then click *Select Folder*.

The project will be created in the selected folder and then opened in VSCode. The project will contain a handful of default files and folders.

`.vscode/` - A directory containing project-specific settings for VSCode. You may delete this folder if you wish.

`.gitignore` - A file containing a list of files and folders that should be ignored by Git. You may delete this file if you wish.

`main.py` - The main Python file for your project. **Do not delete this file.**

> [!warning]
> The default `main.py` file starts with a specific `#!` directive. Each script in your project **must** start with `#!/usr/bin/env pybricks-micropython` in order for EV3Dev to recognize the file as a valid micropython executable.

### Saving a Project
<Swbat>Understand how to save an EV3 project in VSCode.</Swbat>

Save your project by selecting *File > Save* from the menu. You may also save your project by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

> [!tip]
> Saving your project is free. Do it often!

### Opening a Project
<Swbat>Understand how to open an EV3 project in VSCode.</Swbat>

The default behavior of VSCode is to open the last project you were working on. If you want to open a different project, try one of the following methods.

- Open your project by selecting *File > Open Folder* from the menu. Select your project folder and then click *Open*.

- Alternatively, open your project by selecting *File > Open Recent* from the menu and then selecting your project folder from the list.

### Connecting to the EV3 Brick
<Swbat>Understand how to connect to and interact with the EV3 brick using VSCode.</Swbat>

Connect the EV3 Brick to your workstation using the provided USB to Mini-USB connector. Select the Explorer tab from the left sidebar and then find the *EV3 DEVICE BROWSER* view. 

Select *Click here to connect to a device* and then select your device from the dropdown menu that appears. Once connected you will see your device appear in the *EV3 DEVICE BROWSER* view.

The status of the connection will be displayed as a colored dot next to the device name.

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 🟢 Green | Device is connected and ready. |
| 🟡 Yellow | Device connection is pending. |
| 🔴 Red | Device is not connected. |

> [!tip]
> If the EV3 Brick is plugged in, but the device status is red, try right-clicking on the device in the *EV3 DEVICE BROWSER* view and selecting *Retry connection*.

### Uploading a Project
<Swbat>Understand how to upload an EV3 project to the EV3 brick using VSCode.</Swbat>
