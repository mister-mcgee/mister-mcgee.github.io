## The Five Pillars

The core of PTEC's philosophy revolves around our five pillars - Honesty, Integrity, Respect, Responsibility, and Excellence. Every day students and teachers alike should strive to exemplify these pillars. In my class students can demonstrate the five pillars in the following ways.

### Honesty

> *"The quality of being free of deceit and untruthfulness; sincerity"* - Oxford English Dictionary
  

A student can demonstrate **Honesty** in my class by -
- Speaking the truth in good-faith.
- Admitting uncertainty and asking questions. 

### Integrity

> *"Integrity is **doing the right thing when you don’t have to—when no one else is looking** or will ever know—when there will be no congratulations or recognition for having done so."* - Charles Marshall  

A student can demonstrate **Integrity** in my class by -
- Using information and technology to **complement** not **substitute** their work.
- Turning in their own work. 

### Respect

> *"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"* - The Golden Rule  

A student can demonstrate **Respect** in my class by -
- Following directions in good-faith.
- Being a good steward of the classroom and the equipment within.
- Engaging without being disruptive.
- Using kindness when addressing themself or others. 

### Responsibility

> *"Having an **obligation** to do something, or having control over or care for someone ..."* - Oxford English Dictionary  

A student can demonstrate **Responsibility** in my class by -
- Turning in completed work on time.
- Being a staunch self-advocate.
- Coming to class prepared.

### Excellence

> *"Excellence is the gradual result of always striving to do better"* - Pat Riley  

- Applying themself to every project, lesson, and assignment.
- Being willing to make mistakes.
- Learning from mistakes.

> I understand passing period is often not long enough to go to lockers, get water, and wait in line for the bathroom. A student will not be marked tardy if they check in with the instructor during passing period.

### Absences

A student will be marked **absent** when they -
1. Arrive to class more than 10 minutes after the bell **without a pass**.

## Technology

### Digital Accounts & Communication

Students are expected to use school-provided accounts to communicate with instructors and access online resources. This serves two important purposes -

1. To remain professional and accountable, digital communication between students and instructors should always take place via approved channels, such as school-provided email, google classroom, and infinite campus.

2. To maintain student safety and access, students should use school-provided accounts as they can be monitored and reset in the case of hijacked or forgotten credentials.

### Personal Electronics

Students must receive approval from the instructor prior to bringing personal electronics to class. Approved personal electronics may be used to complete in-class work and assignments. Personal electronics are not to be used outside of the classroom without explicit permission.

### Plagiarism and AI

Explicit copying the work of others and attempting to pass it off as your own is **plagiarism** which is prohibited. Similarly, submitting output from an LLM (Large Language Model) or similar tool in place of your own work is prohibited.

**If a student's work is discovered to be plagiarized or the product of AI they will receive a zero on the assignment and a referral to the Dean.**  

### Electronics Privileges

The use of technology in the classroom is a privilege. A student found to be abusing or misusing electronics will have their access revoked and receive a referral to the dean. Infractions include, but are not limited to -

1. Using electronics outside of approved contexts.
2. Failure to return borrowed equipment.
3. Harassment or bullying.
4. Damage of school equipment due to vandalism or negligence.
5. Viewing or sharing of offensive, violent, or sexually explicit material.  

### Liability

Students will be held liable for damages to school equipment exceeding the scope of typical wear and tear.

## Grading Assignments

### Scoring

Assignments will receive a letter grade based on the following scale.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>90% - 100%</td>
    <td>4.0 GPA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>80% - 89.99%</td>
    <td>3.0 GPA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>70% - 79.99%</td>
    <td>2.0 GPA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>60% - 69.99%</td>
    <td>1.0 GPA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>0% - 59.99%</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each assignment will fall into one of four categories where each category contributes to a portion of your overall grade as shown below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Employability</td>
    <td>20%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Classwork</td>
    <td>30%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Projects</td>
    <td>30%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Final</td>

</table>

### Missing and Late Work

All students are expected to submit work on-time. An assignment is considered **late** when it is submitted one day after it is due. An assignment is considered **missing** when it is not submitted or submitted more than one day after it is due.

**Late work will receive half (50%) credit and missing work will receive zero (0%) credit.**

### Excused Absences and Extensions

Students will receive two additional days to complete missing or late work for each excused absence. There may be opportunities for students to complete missing or late work in class; however, students are ultimately expected to complete missing or late work in their own time. Additional extensions may be granted in outstanding circumstances.
