## Overview
### What is a Postmortem?
A postmortem, sometimes called a retrospective, is a form of technical writing analyzing the successes and failures of a project or process. The audience of a postmortem typically consists of engineers and/or designers within adjacent fields, which means the author can expect some degree of domain-specific knowledge from the reader. A good retrospective should offer *specific* insights into a process, outlining decisions and their material impacts on a project. Should the author or audience attempt to continue the work, a postmortem should contain informed suggestions or alternatives to improve later outcomes.
