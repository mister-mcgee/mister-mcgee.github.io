## Managing Godot Projects
<Swbat>Create, edit, and delete projects using the Godot Projects view.</Swbat>

When you first launch Godot, you will see the **Projects** view. This is the hub for all of your games. Every game you make in Godot lives inside a *project*, which is just a folder containing scenes, scripts, and assets.

### Creating a New Project
<Swbat>Create a new Godot project from the Projects view.</Swbat>

1. Launch Godot.
2. In the **Projects** view, click **New Project**.
3. Enter a **Project Name**.
4. Choose or create an empty folder where the project will live.
5. Select the **Renderer** (use the default unless instructed otherwise).
6. Click **Create & Edit**.

Godot will create the project folder and immediately open the editor.

> [!tip]
> Keep your projects organized in a single “Godot Projects” folder so you can always find them later.

### Opening an Existing Project
<Swbat>Open an existing Godot project.</Swbat>

If a project already exists on your computer:

1. Open Godot to the **Projects** view.
2. Select the project from the list.
3. Click **Edit**, or double-click the project name.

Godot remembers recently opened projects and will show them automatically.

### Renaming or Editing a Project
<Swbat>Understand how to manage existing projects.</Swbat>

From the **Projects** view:

- Select a project and click **Rename** to change its display name.
- Select a project and click **Edit** to open it in the editor.

> [!note]
> Renaming a project here does **not** rename the folder on your computer—only how it appears in Godot.

### Deleting a Project
<Swbat>Delete a Godot project safely.</Swbat>

1. Select the project in the **Projects** view.
2. Click **Remove**.
3. Choose whether to:
   - **Remove** (forgets the project but keeps files), or
   - **Remove & Delete** (permanently deletes the project folder).

> [!warning]
> **Remove & Delete cannot be undone.** Make sure you no longer need the project before choosing this option.

## The Godot Editor Interface
<Swbat>Identify and describe the main parts of the Godot Editor.</Swbat>

Once inside a project, you will see the **Godot Editor**. This is where all game creation happens. While it may look overwhelming at first, it is built from a few key panels that work together.

### The Main Editor Screens

At the top of the editor are tabs that switch between different workflows:

- **2D** – For 2D games and interfaces.
- **3D** – For 3D games and environments.
- **Script** – For writing and editing code.
- **AssetLib** – For browsing community-made assets and tools.

Most of your time early on will be spent in **2D** or **3D** mode.

### The Viewport
<Swbat>Use the Viewport to view and manipulate scenes.</Swbat>

The **Viewport** is the large central area of the editor. This is where you:

- See your game world.
- Move, rotate, and scale objects.
- Arrange characters, backgrounds, and UI elements.

Think of the Viewport as the “stage” where your game exists.

### The Scene Dock
<Swbat>Understand how scenes and nodes are organized.</Swbat>

Typically on the left side, the **Scene Dock** shows a tree of **nodes**.

- A **Scene** is a collection of nodes saved together.
- A **Node** is a single game object (sprite, character, camera, etc.).

Scenes form the building blocks of your game.

> [!tip]
> Godot games are built by combining many small scenes together, rather than one giant scene.

### The Inspector
<Swbat>Use the Inspector to edit node properties.</Swbat>

On the right side is the **Inspector**.

- Shows properties of the currently selected node.
- Allows you to change values like position, size, color, and scripts.
- Updates immediately as you make changes.

If you want to *edit how something behaves or looks*, the Inspector is usually where you go.

### The FileSystem Dock
<Swbat>Navigate and manage project files.</Swbat>

Usually at the bottom-left, the **FileSystem** dock shows:

- Scenes (`.tscn`)
- Scripts (`.gd`)
- Images, sounds, and other assets

This mirrors your project folder on disk.

> [!note]
> Deleting files here deletes them from the project folder as well.

### The Output and Debug Panels
<Swbat>Recognize where errors and messages appear.</Swbat>

At the bottom of the editor you may see panels such as:

- **Output** – Messages from the engine and your code.
- **Debugger** – Errors and runtime information when the game is running.

When something goes wrong, **check here first**.
