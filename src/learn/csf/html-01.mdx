## What is the Internet?
The internet is a fascinating piece of infrastructure used by billions of people every day and maintained by millions of engineers and developers around the world. The internet itself is a massive network of computing devices that communicate via a shared protocol known as *Internet Protocol* or *IP* for short.

Internet Protocol describes how data should be packaged and transmitted on the network, including how to route *packets* of data from one *address* to another. All devices connected to the internet use *IP* to communicate with each other.

## What is the World Wide Web?
The internet is *not* the websites you visit every day; or rather, the internet is not *only* the websites you visit every day. The term *World Wide Web* has become somewhat antiquated and is now broadly synonymous with the concept of *the internet*, but from a technical perspective the World Wide Web is only a *part* of the wider internet.

The World Wide Web is a collection of *documents*, *services*, and *applications* that are accessible via the internet, more specifically via a *web browser*. At its inception, the World Wide Web was imagined to be a *hypertext* - a system of documents linked together as part of a sprawling library. The term *hypertext* implied the World Wide Web would revolutionize text in a way that was profoundly different from the standard printed text of the time.

## What is TCP/IP?
Internet Protocol dictates that all data be broken into chunks called *packets*. Fundamentally, each packet contains a *payload* and some *metadata* describing features such as the size of the payload as well as the *source* and *destination* addresses. One of the quirks of the internet is that each packet can take a different path to its destination, meaning that not all packets arrive intact and in the order they were sent (if they arrive at all). This is problematic for applications that send and receive sensitive data, because some or all of the data may be corrupted or lost.

To solve this problem, engineers developed *Transmission Control Protocol* (TCP). TCP works, by including some of its own metadata in the payload of each packet such as a *sequence number* and a *checksum*. This metadata is used by the receiver to reorder and reassemble incoming packets. If a packet does not arrive intact, or fails to arrive in time, the receiver will request the packet again from the sender. This process is called *retransmission*.

Many protocols exist at the same *network layer* as TCP, but few offer the robust fault tolerance that TCP provides. For most applications, TCP is the goto protocol for transmitting data over the internet.

## What is HTTP?
The World Wide Web relies heavily on the *HyperText Transfer Protocol* (HTTP). HTTP is a *request-response* protocol, meaning that a client (your web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server (a website) and the server then returns an HTTP response. The HTTP response includes some metadata describing the nature of the response, as well as a *payload* which might contain additional HTTP metadata, a document, a resource, or some other data.

HTTP is a somewhat verbose plaintext protocol, meaning that HTTP exchanges typically involve dozens if not hundreds of packets. HTTP relies on TCP to ensure the integrity of each HTTP request as it is disassembled and reassembled over the network.

## What is HTML?

*HyperText Markup Language* (HTML) is a markup language that describes the structure of a web document. Almost all web documents, services, and applications include some HTML. When you visit a website, your web browser makes an HTTP request to the server and (if the request is successful) the server sends an HTTP response with the HTML document in its payload. The browser then *parses* the HTML and displays it to you as a web page.

HTML is one of a handful of markup languages that are used on the web, but it is by far the most popular and most widely supported.
