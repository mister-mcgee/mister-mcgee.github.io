    "question": "Binary is used in computing because...",
    "choices": [
      "It is easier for humans to read and write",
      "It can be translated into any language",
      "It makes hardware easier to design and implement",
      "It has always been the default and has never been changed"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Binary is ideal for computers because it aligns well with simple two-state systems like electrical switches."

    "question": "If the decimal number system is base-10, what is base of the binary number system?",
    "choices": [
      "2",
      "8",
      "10",
      "16"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "The binary number system is base-2, meaning it uses only two digits: 0 and 1."

    "question": "Which of the following is a valid binary number?",
    "choices": [
      "1021",
      "11012",
      "1001101",
      "2010"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "A valid binary number only uses the digits 0 and 1, so 1001101 is correct."
