    "question": "What does the binary number 1010 represent in decimal",
    "choices": [
      "8",
      "10",
      "12",
      "14"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "1010 in binary equals (1×8) + (0×4) + (1×2) + (0×1) = 10 in decimal."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many states can be represented by a single byte?",
    "choices": [
      "8",
      "16",
      "128",
      "256"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explain": "A byte is 8 bits, so it can represent 2^8 = 256 different states."
  },
  {
    "question": "Binary is used in computing because...",
    "choices": [
      "It is easier for humans to read and write",
      "It can be translated into any language",
      "It makes hardware easier to design and implement",
      "It has always been the default and has never been changed"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Binary is ideal for computers because it aligns well with simple two-state systems like electrical switches."

  {
    "question": "If the decimal number system is base-10, what is base of the binary number system?",
    "choices": [
      "2",
      "8",
      "10",
      "16"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "The binary number system is base-2, meaning it uses only two digits: 0 and 1."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following is a valid binary number?",
    "choices": [
      "1021",
      "11012",
      "1001101",
      "2010"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "A valid binary number only uses the digits 0 and 1, so 1001101 is correct."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the binary representation of the decimal number 5?",
    "choices": [
      "101",
      "111",
      "1001",
      "1010"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "The binary representation of the decimal number 5 is 101."

    "question": "How many bits are there in a byte?",
    "choices": [
      "4 bits",
      "8 bits",
      "16 bits",
      "32 bits"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "A byte is a grouping of 8 bits."

  {
    "question": "The word 'bit' is a portmanteau of...",
    "choices": [
      "Binary integrated transistor",
      "Binary digit",
      "Binary information technology",
      "Binary instruction"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explain": "A 'bit' is short for a 'binary digit', the smallest unit of information in computing."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of compilers, interpreters, and virtual machines?",
    "choices": [
      "Translate human-readable code into machine-readable instructions",
      "Execute binary instructions directly without translation",
      "Write programs automatically",
      "Store large amounts of data efficiently"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "These tools translate human-readable programming languages into binary instructions the computer hardware can execute."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are natural languages not suitable for programming computers?",
    "choices": [
      "Because they are ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways",
      "Because they don't have enough vocabulary",
      "Because computers don't understand spoken words",
      "Because they are too long"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "Natural languages are inherently ambiguous, which is problematic since computers require precise and unambiguous instructions."
