      "10",
      "11",
      "13",

  {
    "question": "Why is binary used in computers?",
    "choices": [
      "Because it's easier for people to read",
      "Because it uses trinary logic",
      "Because it's simple to represent with switches (on/off)",
      "Because it can represent any letter directly"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "Binary is ideal for computers because it aligns with two-state systems like electrical switches."

      "2",
      "8",
      "10",
      "16"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explain": "The binary number system is base-2, meaning it uses only two digits: 0 and 1."

    "question": "Which of the following is a valid binary number?",
    "choices": [
      "1021",
      "11012",
      "1001101",
      "2010"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explain": "A valid binary number only uses the digits 0 and 1, so 1001101 is correct."
