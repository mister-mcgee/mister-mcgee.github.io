Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that's widely used for web development, data analysis, automation, and much more. Wether you are new to programming or an experienced programmer, Python is there to help you GetStuffDone:tm:.

Today, your Python journey begins with installing Python by [using the official installer](#using-the-official-installer) or [using the Microsoft Store](#using-the-microsoft-store).

# Using the Official Installer

### 1. Download the Python Installer
Navigate to the official [downloads](https://python.org/downloads) page of the Python website. Click <kbd>Download Python X.X.X</kbd> where `X.X.X` is the latest version number. At the time of writing, the current version is `3.12.6`.

### 2. Run the Python Installer
Locate the installer (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to run. Once the installation dialog appears, click through the default installation options. After the installation process has completed, you should be prompted with a dialog that says "Setup was Successful". Click <kbd>Close</kbd> to finish.

### 3. Verify the Installation
Press <kbd><IconBrandWindows className="inline-block pb-1"/></kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open the Run dialog. Type "cmd", and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open Command Prompt. Type the following command into the terminal and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```cmd
python --version
```

You should see the Python version number that corresponds to the runtime you just installed.

```cmd

```

# Using Microsoft Store

Click on the Microsoft Store icon in the taskbar or search for “Microsoft Store” in the Start menu. In the Microsoft Store search bar type “Python.” Select the desired runtime from the list of Python versions available.
