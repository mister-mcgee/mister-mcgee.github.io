Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that's widely used for web development, data analysis, automation, and much more. 

Your python journey begins with installing python by [using the official installer](#installing-python-using-the-official-installer) or [using the Microsoft Store](#installing-python-using-the-microsoft-store). This article will walk you through both methods to ensure you have a smooth setup.

# Installing Python Using the Official Installer

### 1. Download the Python Installer
Navigate to the official [downloads](https://python.org/downloads) page of the Python website. Click <kbd>Download Python X.X.X</kbd> where **X.X.X** is the latest version number. At the time of writing, the current version is **3.12.6**.

### 2. Run the Python Installer
Locate the installer (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to run. Once the installation dialog appears, click through the default installation options. After the installation has completed, you should be prompted with a dialog that says **"Setup was successful"**. Click <kbd>Close</kbd> to finish.

### 3. Verify the Installation
Press <kbd><IconBrandWindows className="inline-block pb-1"/></kbd> + <kbd>**R**</kbd> to open the **Run** dialog. Type `cmd`, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open Command Prompt. Type the following command and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

```cmd
python --version
```

You should see the Python version number you just installed.

```cmd
Python 3.12.6
```

# Installing Python via the Microsoft Store
Step 1: Open the Microsoft Store
Launch Microsoft Store: Click on the Microsoft Store icon in the taskbar or search for “Microsoft Store” in the Start menu.
Step 2: Search for Python
Search for Python: In the Microsoft Store search bar, type “Python.” You’ll see a list of Python versions available. Typically, you can choose between Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or other versions depending on the current availability.

Select Python Version: Click on the version you want to install (e.g., Python 3.11). This will take you to the app’s page in the Microsoft Store.

Step 3: Install Python
Click Install: On the Python app page, click the “Install” button. The Microsoft Store will handle the installation process.

Wait for Installation to Complete: The installation may take a few minutes. Once it’s done, you can see the installed Python version in your Start menu.

Step 4: Verify the Installation
Open Command Prompt: Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter to open Command Prompt.

Check Python Version: Type python --version and press Enter to see the installed Python version.

Verify Pip Installation: Type pip --version to confirm that pip is installed and working.

Conclusion
Whether you choose to install Python via the official installer or the Microsoft Store, both methods are straightforward and effective. The official installer gives you more control over installation options and paths, while the Microsoft Store offers a quick and easy setup. Either way, you’ll have Python up and running on your Windows machine, ready for your coding projects!

Feel free to follow these steps, and happy coding!
