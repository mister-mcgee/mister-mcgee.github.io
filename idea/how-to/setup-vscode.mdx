Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular, lightweight code editor that's great for writing and debugging code. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, VS Code provides a rich set of features and extensions to enhance your coding experience.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of installing Visual Studio Code on a Windows system using either the official installer or the Microsoft Store.

# Using the Official Installer
### 1. Download the Visual Studio Code Installer
Navigate to the official [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) page. Click on <kbd>Download for Windows</kbd>. This will trigger the download of a file named something like `VSCodeUserSetup-X.X.X.exe`, where `X.X.X` represents the latest version number. At the time of writing, the current version is `1.93.0`.

### 2. Run the Visual Studio Code Installer
Once the download is complete, locate the installer (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it to run. Once the installation dialog appears, click through the default installation options.

### 3. Complete the Installation
After the installation process is complete, you should see a dialog indicating that the setup was successful. Click <kbd>Finish</kbd> to exit the installer and launch Visual Studio Code.

# Using Microsoft Store
### 1. Search for Visual Studio Code
Open the Microsoft Store by clicking its icon in the taskbar or searching for “Microsoft Store” in the Start menu. In the Microsoft Store search bar, type “Visual Studio Code.” From the search results, select the [Visual Studio Code](ms-windows-store://pdp?hl=en-us&gl=us&productid=xp9khm4bk9fz7q&mode=mini&pos=0%2C0%2C1920%2C1020) application.

### 2. Install Visual Studio Code
Depending on your version of Windows, click on either <kbd>Get</kbd> or <kbd>Install</kbd> and wait for the installation to complete.

### 3. Launch and Verify
Once installed, you can launch Visual Studio Code directly from the Microsoft Store by clicking <kbd>Open</kbd>, or find it in your Start menu. Open the application to confirm that the installation was successful.
