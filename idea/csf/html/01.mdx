### What is HTML?

## HTML Tags

### [`<html>`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_html.asp)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

The `<html>` tag represents the root of an HTML document.

The`<html>` tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the `<!DOCTYPE>` tag).

> [!info] Note
> You should always include the `lang` attribute inside the `<html>` tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

### [`<head>`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_head.asp)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- ... -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- ... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

The `<head>` element is a container for **metadata** (data about data) and is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag.

Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

> [!info] Note
> The following elements can go inside the `<head>` element:
> `<title>`
> `<style>`
> `<base>`
> `<link>`
> `<meta>`
> `<script>`
> `<noscript>`


### [`<title>`](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp)

```html
<!-- ... -->
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
<!-- ... -->
```

The `<title>` tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

The `<title>` tag is required in HTML documents!

The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

> [!info] The `<title>` element
> - defines a title in the browser toolbar
> - provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
> - displays a title for the page in search-engine results

> [!warning] Note
> You can **NOT** have more than one `<title>` element in an HTML document.
