# Overview

# What is a Computer?

### A Brief History of Computing

It is well argued that the first computer was a mechanical calculator invented by Charles Babbage in 1837 known as the Difference Engine. At the time, if someone wanted to know the result of a complex mathematical equation, they would have to either perform the calculation by hand or use a table of precomputed values. The problem being that this was very time consuming and prone to errors. Babbage sought to address this issue by building a machine that could precisely and reliably perform the arithmetic in a fraction of the time it would take a human to do so.

After constructing the Difference Engine, Babbage moved on to design a relatively powerful machine capable of more complex calculations that he called the Analytical Engine. Although it was never actually built, the Analytical Engine is often cited as the first programmable mechanical computer. A mathematician by the name of Ada Lovelace is credited with being the first person to write a program for the Analytical Engine over correspondence with Babbage.

Advances in computing remained relatively stagnant for about another hundred years. That is until World War II, when a mathematician by the name of Alan Turing developed an electromechanical computing device known as The Bombe which was used to crack the German Enigma code. Often referred to as "The Father of Computer Science", Turing laid the foundation for modern computing and paved the way for the arrival of the first digital computers.
