# What is a Computer?

### A Brief History of Computing

Computers as we know them today are a relatively new invention. It wasn't even one hundred years ago that the first "modern" computers were built; however, the concept of a "Thinking Machine" has existed for much longer.

The first mechanical computing device, dubbed the "Difference Engine", was proposed by Charles Babbage in 1822. It was intended to help automate the publication of astronomical and mathematical tables. At the time, these tables were computed by hand, which was both time-consuming and prone to human error. Babbage sought to remove the human element from this process by using a machine to perform the calculations.

Various obstacles began to arise during the development of the Difference Engine, and ultimately the project was abandoned. It wasn't until nearly one hundred years later that a mathematician named Alan Turing would catapult the field of computing into the modern era.

Often cited as the "Father of Computer Science", Turing's work laid the foundation for modern computing. During World War II, he and his team played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code with the help of their electromechanical computer known as "The Bombe." Many principles and ideas within the field of Computer Science have roots in Turing's work with more than one inheriting his name.
