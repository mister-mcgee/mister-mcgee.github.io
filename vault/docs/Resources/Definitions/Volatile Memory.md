**Volatile Memory** - Volatile memory is a kind of [memory](docs/Resources/Definitions/Memory.md) that requires active power to store information, meaning that volatile memory *cannot* survive a power cycle. Volatile memory is typically faster to [read](docs/Resources/Definitions/Read.md) than [persistent storage](docs/Resources/Definitions/Persistent%20Storage.md).
