**Memory Address** - A memory address is a [[Binary|binary]] number (usually 32 [[Bit|bits]] wide or 64 [[Bit|bits]] wide), which describes the physical location of a chunk in [[Memory|memory]]. It is less efficient to address individual [[Bit|bits]] so a computer's **memory** is broken into chunks called [[definitions/Byte|bytes]] where each [[definitions/Byte|byte]] has its own address.
