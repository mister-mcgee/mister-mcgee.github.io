**Memory Address** - A memory address is a [binary](/docs/Resources/Definitions/Binary) number (usually 32 [bits](docs/Resources/Definitions/Bit.md) wide or 64 [bits](docs/Resources/Definitions/Bit.md) wide), which describes the physical location of a chunk in [memory](docs/Resources/Definitions/Memory.md). It is less efficient to address individual [bits](docs/Resources/Definitions/Bit.md) so a computer's [memory](docs/Resources/Definitions/Memory.md) is broken into chunks called [bytes](docs/Resources/Definitions/Byte.md) where each [byte](docs/Resources/Definitions/Byte.md) has its own address.
