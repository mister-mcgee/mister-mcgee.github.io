**ODD** - An ODD or *optical disk drive* is a kind of [persistent storage](/docs/Resources/Definitions/Persistent%20Storage) device that stores information on a spinning disk using a laser. Because the disk has to be physically moved to to [read](docs/Resources/Definitions/Read.md) or [write](docs/Resources/Definitions/Write.md) to certain [locations](docs/Resources/Definitions/Memory%20Address.md), an ODD *is not* a form of [random access](docs/Resources/Definitions/Random%20Access.md) [storage](docs/Resources/Definitions/Memory.md).
