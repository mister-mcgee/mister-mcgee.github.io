# Variables

Variables are how you store and access data in a **program**. In Python, a variable always has a name, a **type**, and a value. It is useful to think of a variable as a box that stores a thing. A value is what is stored in the box, a type describes what is stored in the box, and a name is a unique way of identifying the box.

In Python a variable can be assigned via the assignment operator `=`, which looks like -

```py
a = 0      # The variable named "a" is assigned to the integer value "0"
b = 0.0    # The variable named "b" is assigned to the floating point value "0.0"
c = False  # The variable named "c" is assigned to the boolean value "False"
d = "Zero" # The variable named "d" is assigned to the string value "Zero"
```
