# Comments

Many programming languages support the use of comments which are a way to include arbitrary text in your code. Comments are often used to leave notes in your code for your future self or other programmers. In Python, adding a comment looks like this -

```py
# Everything on this line after the "#" is a comment!
```

Everything on a line after a `#` is considered a comment by the Python interpreter and will be ignored when running your code.
