**ODD** - An ODD or *optical disk drive* is a kind of [persistent storage](/docs/Glossary/Persistent%20Storage) device that stores information on a spinning disk using a laser. Because the disk has to be physically moved to to [read](docs/Glossary/Read.md) or [write](docs/Glossary/Write.md) to certain [locations](docs/Glossary/Memory%20Address.md), an ODD *is not* a form of [random access](docs/Glossary/Random%20Access.md) [storage](docs/Glossary/Memory.md).
